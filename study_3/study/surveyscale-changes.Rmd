# Description

This file explains changes made to survey items for the purposes of our study.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#Load file, add blank new items
dat.s <- read_csv("surveyscales-original.csv", col_types = cols(.default = "c")) %>%
  mutate(item.new = "")
#Display random rows
dat.s %>%
  sample_n(5)
```


# Changes

## 1. Conversion to Australian spelling

As sample will be Australians, we ensured all scales used Australian spelling.


### SVSS

#### Items

**conformity** item wording, from "honoring" to "honouring"
**security** item wording, from "favors" to "favours"

```{r}
dat.s <- dat.s %>%
    rowwise %>%
    mutate(item.new = if_else(scale == "SVSS" & subscale == "conformity", "CONFORMITY (obedience, honouring parents and elders, self-discipline, politeness)",
                              if_else(scale == "SVSS" & subscale == "security", "SECURITY (national security, family security, social order, cleanliness, reciprocation of favours)", item.original)
                              ))
#Show new SVSS scale
dat.s %>%
  filter(scale == "SVSS")
```

### Conspiracist ideation

```{r}
dat.s <- dat.s %>%
    rowwise %>%
    mutate(item.new = if_else(scale == "CI" & item.original == "The assassination of John F. Kennedy was not committed by the lone gunman Lee Harvey Oswald but was rather a detailed organized conspiracy to kill the President.", "The assassination of John F. Kennedy was not committed by the lone gunman Lee Harvey Oswald but was rather a detailed organised conspiracy to kill the President.", item.original))
#Show new CI scale
dat.s %>%
  filter(scale == "SVSS")
```

### System Justification

Changed references to America and the United States to Australia (within the CSV itself).


## 2. Conversion from "global warming" to "climate change"

### Knowledge Volume

Rephrased the one **Knowledge Volume** item


```{r}
dat.s <- dat.s %>%
  mutate(item.new = if_else(scale == "KV", "How much do you feel you know about climate change?", item.new))
#Show new KV scale
dat.s %>%
  filter(scale == "KV")
```

### Worry item

Changed explanatory text for worry item.

# Alteration to structure of scales

## Worry item

As worry item was taken from a multi-item scale, reduced explanatory text and item into a single item.

# Order scales without a specified order

In this study, the items for each scale will be randomised *once* and administered to the sample (unless scale was validated with a specific order; e.g., the NCS-6). That is, for each scale, participants will encounter items in the same order as other participants.

```{r}
#Assign seed
set.seed(012691)
#Order items
dat.s <- dat.s %>%
  group_by(scale, add = F) %>%
  mutate(order.original = row_number()) %>%
  mutate(order.new = if_else(alreadyordered == "Y", order.original, sample(order.original, length(order.original), replace = F)))
#Assign ID to each item, based on scale and order
dat.s <- dat.s %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(item.id = paste0(scale, "-", order.new))
#Show new orders
dat.s %>%
  filter(alreadyordered != "Y")
```


# Export scales

Arrange on the basis of item order, for each scale

```{r}
dat.s <- dat.s %>% 
  group_by(scale) %>% 
  arrange(order.new, .by_group = T)
dat.s %>%
  write_csv("surveyscales-new.csv")
#Show new dat.s
dat.s
```

# Create a diagram-balanced Latin square for scale order

Survey consists of:

1. Mental model scales (see Study 1 directory)
2. Non-mental model scales

```{r}
#Function to create diagram-balanced Latin squares
create_dbls <- function(n, as.letter = F){
  #Takes number of conditions (n) and returns the diagram-balanced Latin square(s)
  #If as.letter = T, return squares in letter format, if false/null, use numbers
  #If n > 26, letters cannot be used
  if(as.letter){
    if(n > 26){
      print("number of conditions are greater than number of available letters (26), using numbers instead")
      as.letter <- F
    }
  }
  #Firstly, create one empty cyclic Latin square
  cls <- matrix(1:n, n, n, byrow = T)
  #Create two empty diagram-balanced Latin squares
  dbls <- matrix(0, n, n)
  for (i in 1:n){
    #Cycle previous row to create a cyclic square, unnecessary for first row
    if(i > 1){
    old.seq <- cls[i - 1, ] #old sequence, to be shifted one to the left
    cls[i, ] <- old.seq %% n + 1 #shifts sequence to the left
    }
    #Interleave sequence from cyclic latin square
    il.seq <- suppressWarnings(as.vector(rbind(cls[i, ], rev(cls[i, ]))))
    dbls[i, ] <- il.seq[1:n]
  }
  #Create a warning to ensure users know which squares ensure counterbalance
  msg <- if_else((n %% 2) > 0, "Use both Diagram-Balanced Latin Squares to ensure adequate counterbalance",
                 "Use either Diagram-Balanced Latin Square to ensure adequate counterbalance")
  print(msg)
  #If necessary, conver to letters
  if(as.letter){
    dbls <- apply(dbls, c(1,2), function(x){return(LETTERS[x])})
  }
  #Return the diagram-balanced Latin squares
  list(dbls, dbls[ , n:1]) %>%
  return()
}

#TESTING FUNCTION
is.dbls <- function(ls){
  #Function to test if input (ls) is a diagram-balanced Latin square
  #Check of Latin square contains characters, if so, convert to numbers
  if(is.character(ls)){
    ls <- apply(ls, 1:2, function(x){return(which(LETTERS == x))})
  }
  #n = number of conditions
  n <- nrow(ls)
  #for each condition in the Latin square, verify conditions are counterbalanced
  for(i in 1:n){
    for(j in 1:n){
      #i and j are two conditions
      if(i != j){
        #determine which sequences have i immediately preceed/proceed j
        #test is a vector, for each sequence, 1 indicates i immediately followed j, -1 indicated j immediately followed i
        #0 indicates neither option
        test <- apply(ls, 1, function(x){
            ans <- 0
            ans.i <- which(x == i)
            ans.j <- which(x == j)
            if(abs(ans.i - ans.j) == 1){
              ans <- ans.i - ans.j
            }
            return(ans)
            })
      #test should have one -1, one +1, and rest 0s
      res <- all.equal(c(-1, rep(0, n - 2), 1), sort(test))
      if(is.character(res)){
        print(sprintf("Not a Latin square, conditions %d and %d are not counterbalanced", i, j))
        return(FALSE)
      }
      }
    }
  }
  #If loop hasn't been stopped, then input is a Diagram-balanced Latin square
  return(TRUE)
}

###Processing


#Set seed
set.seed(891739)
#Create vector of scale blocks, randomised
blocknames <- dat.s %>%
  pull(scale) %>%
  unique %>%
  c("MM") %>%
  sample(length(.), replace = F)
#If number of blocks is odd, use both diagram-balanced Latin squares, else randomly select one
dbls <- length(blocknames) %>%
  create_dbls(as.letter = F)

###Check if dbls is actually diagram-balanced
check.dbls <- lapply(dbls, is.dbls)
if(!all(unlist(check.dbls))){
    print("Warning: Latin squares are not diagram-balanced. Please check create_dbls function and associated processing.")

} else {
  print("Latin squares are diagram-balanced.")
  if((length(blocknames) %% 2) > 0){
    #If number of blocks is odd, use both
    dbls <- dbls %>%
      {do.call("rbind", .)}
  } else{
    #randomly sample one of the two DBLS
  dbls <- dbls %>%
    {.[[sample(1:2,1)]]}
  }
  #Replace each number in DBLS with a block
  dbls <- dbls %>%
    apply(1:2, function(x){return(blocknames[x])})
  #Write dbls to .csv
  dbls %>%
    write.table(file="latin-square.txt", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE)
  #Display latin square
  dbls
}
